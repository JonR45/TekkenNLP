# Tekken8 Topic Modeling - Extracting topics being discussed in YoutTube comments

# Project Overview
- **Programming language**: Python
- **Problem type**: Unsupervised Natural Language Processing
- **Dataset**: YouTube top level comments obtained from the YouTube API
- **Models**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF)
- **Notes**: tidbits
- **Conclusion**:

  
## Objective
Gain insight into the topics being discussed in response to the _'New character reveal'_ YouTube video.

## Key results:
- Human interpretable topics
- Coherence score of >0.4.
- Perplexity?


## Models
- LDA - why chose it, results
- NMF- why chose it - results

# Visualisation
Coherence score visual

# Installation and Running the Project



You want an average technically competent stranger to be able to read your README file and then run the project on their own. This ensures that more technical hiring managers can reproduce your work and check your code. You can find good README examples
here and here.  https://github.com/VikParuchuri/apartment-finder/blob/master/README.md
https://github.com/dataquestio/loan-prediction/blob/master/README.md


Ideally, you’d also want:
•	Some bullet points with interesting observations you found in exploration
•	Any interesting charts or diagrams you created
•	Information about the model, such as algorithm
•	Error rates and other information about the predictions
•	Any notes about real-world usage of the model
The summary here is that the README is the best way to sell your project, and you shouldn’t neglected. Don’t spend a lot of effort making a good project, then have people skip looking through it because they don’t find it interesting!


It’s important to go through the installation steps yourself in a new folder or on a new computer, to make sure everything works.
