He was always a very unique Character so maybe we get someone who is Similar in playstyle. I dont think they will add him as a DLC for T8 again after T7. Also sad for not having Armor King which was also kind of my main character.

I know that devil jin is a popular character and the devs probably don&#39;t want to remove him but I think story-wise jin should be far past the can&#39;t control devil powers stuff.

I guess this is Bamcu&#39;s way of cutting corners and filing more slots for DLC characters... thus making more money...

And very careless not to mention soulless. It&#39;s like Cartoon Network all over again. With  their money solely relies on toys and merch rather than anything else. I have a feeling that but I know they gone the way of Cartoon Network when it comes to video games. They need to sell merch around the world in order to stay alive for certain games.

Just that even though I started out being excited for this game no updates apart from the yoshi design and jun returning did excite me. I realize that my likes and dislikes in everything new seems to be the opposite of what the fandom normally thinks nowadays, which seemed to stay around the same age, that also makes sense if you target a certain demographic. The &#39;legendary&#39; characters mostly arent that legendary for me. <br>I guess its time to say goodbye to a franchise that gave me 25 years of great memories e.g. a birthday party tournament with Tekken3 team battle mode, etc.üòÖ I&#39;ll just go back and play the older ones. <br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDxrpSqYHD8&amp;t=85"">1:25</a>"
